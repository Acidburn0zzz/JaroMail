* Outbox as maildir
  also multiple outboxes for different send programs
   for example anonymous/ for the mixmaster queue

* Anonymizer

  mutt or mu in debian?

* Speedmail or Quickmail
  write down a mail from commandline and send it right away (if online)

   use timecloud for a jquery visualization
 + include anu arg's mailinglist statistics

* REJECTED Local Bayesian learning spam filter (bogofilter)
