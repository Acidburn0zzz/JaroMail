odP   your humble and faithful electronic postman   v 1.0

A commandline tool to easily and privately handle your e-mail

Homepage with more information and links to the manual:

	      	   	             http://jaromail.dyne.org



* INSTALL

Use the install script.

It will check for all requirements on your system to be satisfied.

Give it a path as argument if you want to install your Jaro Mail
directory into something different than Mail inside your Home.

./install.sh ./Testing

will install a new Jaro Mail instance into a new Testing folder

Jaro Mail is completely reentrant: if you install it in multiple
locations you can have completely separated setups, with multiple
identities and different filters.

* USAGE instructions

See the commandline help:

 jaro -h

and make sure to read the manual: it contains a lot of useful tips!



* BUILD (not necessary for OSX binary packages)

Use the build scripts in build/

You will need a compiler installed (XCode on Apple/OSX)

But if you use Apple/OSX you can simply download the binary.

If you are building then, first enter the build subdir

cd build
./build-gnu.sh (or osx)

A Manual is in the works



* DEVELOPERS

All revisioned in Git, see http://code.dyne.org/jaromail

To clone anonymously use

 git clone git://code.dyne.org/jaromail.git

Patches welcome.

Come on channel #dyne on http://hinezumi.im to get in touch with devs



* DONATE

Money donations are very welcome and well needed, they will encourage
further development even beyond my own needs for this software.
