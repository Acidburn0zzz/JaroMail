Jaro Mail 1.1 - 18 October 2012 - Slick bastard

	Lots of bugfixes, code cleanups and usability improvements are
	paving the way for some new powerful features.

	The addressbook system has been enhanced to permit editing of the
	entries in white and blacklist, plus import and export of VCards
	is now possible.

	The use of GnuPG in Mutt is fixed, along with performance
	and usability improvements also to search.

	Vim is now used as default editor, configured to properly format
	emails with paragraph justification.

	More improvements were done also to the management of multiple
	accounts, mailbox filtering, maildir merge and backup.

Jaro Mail 1.0 - 18 June 2012 - E-Data addict

	Software development went forward in a rather passionate way,
	mostly motivated by the author's need to backup his rather big
	archive of e-mails. So this release's focus is on stability,
	search and backup features and a rather deep refactoring of the
	codebase.

	Mairix has been added as an integrated search engine.

	Backup is possible also using search expressions (see manual)

	Some new modules in statistics implement jquery reports.

	Code is modularized in pre-compiled zsh modules.

	Extensive testing has proven the whole setup to be stable and
	ready for production use, hence the 1.0 release.

Jaro Mail 0.9 - 06 May 2012 - The rush of the unemployed

	After getting recently unemployed because of European austerity
	cuts (and because of not working in a bank), Jaromil followed up
	with a full pijama coding session that lasted about a week,
	hammering out most issues that make now this software enter BETA
	stage, while starting to use it for real.

	This is the first public release of Jaro Mail, it comes with a
	User Manual and lots of usability fixes over the previous, it was
	tested on GNU and OSX operating systems.


Jaro Mail 0.1 - 29 May 2012 - Initial release

	After a dozen years of development and use, Jaromil releases his
	own e-mail and mailinglist desktop setup.

	While doing so, J. asked his friend and PhD colleague Max
	Kazemzadeh how he should call it, and Max replied: Jaro Mail! :^D
