	that lasted about a week, hammering out most issues
	that make now this software enter BETA stage, while
	starting to use it for real.

	This is the first public release of Jaro Mail,
	it comes with a User Manual and lots of usability
	fixes over the previous, it was tested on GNU and OSX
	operating systems.


Jaro Mail 0.1 - 29 May 2012 - Initial release
	After a dozen years of development and use,
	Jaromil releases his own e-mail and mailinglist
	desktop setup.
	While doing so, J. asked his friend and PhD colleague
	Max Kazemzadeh how he should call it, and Max replied:
	Jaro Mail! :^D
