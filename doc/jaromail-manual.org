* Introduction

Jaro Mail is an integrated suite of interoperable tools to manage
e-mail communication in a private and efficient way, without relying
too much on on-line services, in fact encouraging users to store their
email locally.

Rather than reinventing the wheel, this suite reuses existing free and
open source tools and protocols and is mainly targeted for
GNU/Linux/BSD desktop usage.

This manual illustrates the usage of Jaro Mail. The newest version of
this manual is made available on http://files.dyne.org/jaromail/jaromail-manual.pdf

** Vision

The internet offers plenty of free services, on the wave of the Web2.0
fuzz and the community boom, while all private informations are hosted
on servers owned by global corporations and monopolies.

It is important to keep in mind that no-one else better than you can
ensure the privacy of your personal data. Server hosted services and
web integrated technologies gather all data into huge information
pools that are made available to established economical and cultural
regimes.

The vision behind this software is that of sharing a simple and
consistent way to operate e-mail communication with tools that are
available on most platforms and can be as well used remotely over a
secure shell connection.

Jaro Mail aims to facilitate the task of downloading and storing e-mail
archives off-line in a way that they can be still accessible in more
than 10 years time and independently of any software. Nowadays many
users have the habit of keeping all their e-mails on servers,
accessing them through an often clumsy web interface, while
downloading them can free space and improve their privacy.

* Setup

** Build

   There are two *build-* scripts coming with the sourcecode of Jaro
   Mail and they are both found in the *build/* subdirectory.

   One is for building it on GNU/Linux systems, the other for
   Apple/OSX.

   A compiler and various dependencies are mandatory in order to build
   this software. The version for GNU/Linux so far supports only
   Debian systems and will use apt-get (requiring sudo access) to
   install all needed packages.

   Apple/OSX users that have no experience in building software can
   obtain a pre-built universal binary from our download zone on
   http://files.dyne.org/jaromail/binary


** Install

   Installing Jaro Mail once all dependencies are build is fairly
   easy: the *install.sh* script provided will create a working
   environment in your *$HOME/Mail* directory or, if you like, you can
   specify a different one as an argument:

: $ cd jaromail
: $ ./install.sh $HOME/Mail

   Every installation of Jaro Mail is fully reentrant, meaning the
   directory where it gets installed contains all maildirs,
   configurations, filters, whitelist and other necessary files.

   Installing it in different directories a single user can have
   multiple Jaro Mail installations to permit the complete separation
   of E-Mail identities.

   If called from outside the installation directory, the *jaro*
   command will use the default path *$HOME/Mail*. If one is using a
   different installation path then should first change to that
   directory and then use the command from inside it.

* Configuration

** Receive mail

   The place where Jaro Mail is installed ($HOME/Mail by default)
   contains a *jaro* folder where all configuration files are found.

   There, inside the directory *Accounts*, are some brief instructions
   and some default templates which can be filled in with Imap or Pop
   account configuration to fetch mail. A default template will be
   found in fresh installations: *Accounts/imap.default.txt*. The
   configuration can be edited with one's favourite text editor, the
   format of the file is pretty self-explanatory.

   It is possible to have more than one account and in fact when
   retreiving e-mails using the *jaro fetch* command all accounts will
   be processed, unless one is explicitly selected using the *-a*
   commandline option.



** Send mail

   Also inside the *jaro/Accounts* directory is found the
   *smtp.default.txt* file that configures how to send mail.

   When no special account is specified using the *-a* option, then
   the file named *smtp.default.txt* into the Accounts folder will be
   used. To fix a selection it is also possible to use a symbolic
   link.

   There is also a file *jaro/Mutt.txt* that can be configured with
   some customized settings for the mail transport agent, such as
   custom headers appearing in composed e-mails and the default GPG[fn:gpg]
   key to be used when signing and encrypting them.

[fn:gpg] GPG stands for GNU Privacy Guard, a system to securely
encrypt and decrypt messages and files so that noone can read their
content, even when intercepting the communication.

** Filter mail

   The file *jaro/Filters.txt* can be edited to configure mailinglist
   and other filters referencing the contents of the *From:* or *To:*
   fields of each e-mail that is fetched.

   The format of the filters configurarion is pretty easy and self
   explanatory, those rules will be applied to mails saved on the
   local filesystem in maildirs that will be created when needed.







* Organization

One of the main goals for Jaro Mail is to organize the e-mail workflow
so that one's attention is dedicated to important communications,
rather than being constantly distracted by various degrees of spam and
the need to weed it out of the mailbox. This ambitious task is pursued
by realizing an integrated approach consisting of flexible
whitelisting and the distinction between mails from known people and
the rest.

** Folders

First lets start with a categorization of the standard maildirs and a
brief description for each. This information is *very important* to
understand how Jaro Mail works: these maildirs are standard in Jaro
Mail, here they are listed in order of priority

| Folder         | What goes in there                               |
|----------------+--------------------------------------------------|
| *known*        | Mails whose sender is known (Whitelist)          |
| *priv*         | Unknown sender, we are the explicit destination  |
| *unsorted*     | Unknown sender, we are in cc: or somehow reached |
| *unsorted.ml*  | From a mailinglist that we haven't filtered yet  |
| *zz.blacklist* | Mails whose sender is not desired (Blacklist)    |

The advantage using such a folder organization is that every time we
open up the mail reader we will be presented with something we are
likely to be most interested in (known people replying our mails) and
progressively, as we will have the time to scroll through, mails from
"new people" or mass mailings of sort. Please note this organization
does not includes spam, which is supposedly weeded out on the server
via spamlists: White/Blacklisting has more to do with our own
selection of content sources than with the generic protection from
random pieces of information.

** Whitelist

The way whitelisting works if quite crucial to this setup and, at the
same time, is fairly simple since it does not include any automatic
detection, learning filters, Markov chains or Bayesian A/I. We believe
the user should be in full control of prioritizing communication
channels and at the same time constantly able to tweak the setup in an
easy way.

To whitelist an address is sufficient to send it an e-mail: at the
moment the message is sent Jaro Mail will remember the destination
address and prioritize all messages coming back from it.
This we call implicit whitelisting.

To explicitly whitelist an address from inside the mail reader index
press [ *a* ] while selecting an email, this will add in the whitelist
the sender address (From: header). If you want to add all addresses
reached by the mail (From: To: and Cc: fields) use the same letter
capitalized pressing shift [ *A* ].

All addresses selected this way will have the privilege of ending up
in your *known/* folder, plus their name and e-mail will be completed
automatically when composing a new email, pressing the *Tab* key while
indicating them among the recipients.

** Blacklist

To blacklist an address instead one can use the [ *z* ] key while an
e-mail is selected on the index: the sender indicated in the From:
field will be downgraded to the very bottom of your priorities, closes
to spam than the rest, the most infamous *zz.blacklist/* folder.

** Addressbook

What we call addressbook here basically consists of both the whitelist
and the blacklist. We store both lists in a unique database file in
*Mail/jaro/addressbook*[fn:sqlite].  In future we may add similar
support for other addressbook formats that people use (GnuPG keyring,
Evolution etc.)[fn:appleaddr]

[fn:sqlite] Jaro Mail uses sqlite3 as its own database storage

[fn:appleaddr] On Apple/OSX systems Jaro Mail has access to the Mail.app addressbook, so all contacts known in your Mac will be automatically whitelisted

Both the white and blacklist can be edited using a text interface,
this way you can delete entries for instance (removing them from the
whitelist or blacklist), or add entries by hand (for instance manually
from visit cards), as well you can change details directly (name and
email). To edit the addressbook in Jaro Mail the *abook* command is
available
: $ jaro abook
This will open the current whitelist for edit, but one can append
"blacklist" to this commandline to open that one instead.

To quickly dump to the console all names and addresses in the Jaro
Mail addressbook, one can use the *list* command
: $ jaro list
To search a string across the addressbook, simply use the command
search followed by a string, for instance:
: $ jaro search autistici
will list all addresses @autistici in your addressbook.

Even more useful to interface with other addressbook
software and mobile phones, you can use the *export* and *import*
functions to transport your addressbook formatted as a series of
VCards[fn:vcard].
: $ jaro export
Will create or update the file in *Mail/jaro/addressbook.vcf*. On the
other hand, the import command will include all entries found in a
given VCard file that have at least one email address.
: $ jaro import 00001.vcf
Imports into the whitelist all contacts found in the 00001.vcf file.
The VCard format is fully compatible with import and export of
contacts in Android mobile phones.

Apple Mac/OSX users can simply run the import command without any arguments
: $ jaro import
Imports all the contacts found in the system addressbook used by Mail.app,
hence making them whitelisted.

[fn:vcard] A file format standard for electronic business cards, see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard

** Organization In Brief

Below a recapitulation of keys related to the white and blacklisting
functionality, to be used in the e-mail index or when an e-mail is
open inside the mail user agent:

| List  | Key         | Function                   | Fields        |
|-------+-------------+----------------------------+---------------|
| White | *a*         | Add the sender address     | From:         |
| White | *A* (shift) | Add all addresses          | From: To: Cc: |
| Black | *z*         | Blacklist the sender       | From:         |

And here the addressbook commands that are available from the
commandline:

| Command  | Function                 |
|----------+--------------------------|
| *abook*  | edit the addressbook     |
| *list*   | list the addressbook     |
| *search* | search a name or address |
| *export* | export to a VCard file   |
| *import* | import from a VCard file |

* Workflow

This section goes through a scenario of simple usage for Jaro Mail

** Fetch and read your mail at home

As you acces your computer where Jaro Mail has been configured, you
can open a Terminal and type:
: $ jaro fetch
This will download all new mails.

If you have configured *fetchall* among the imap account options, then
will delete them from the server, freeing online space.

If you have configured the *keep* option, which is the default, Jaro
Mail will only download the email that you have not yet read and in
any case it won't delete anything from the server.
: $ jaro
This will open the first folder containing unread emails, starting from
the *known* folder, then *priv*, then all the rest.

From there on, pressing *=* or *c* you can change the folder and
explore your *priv* folder, the mailinglist ones as configured by your
Filters.txt, as well your *unsorted* mails.

** Write a new mail

If you like to write a mail to someone, just write his/her own address
as an argument to Jaro Mail
: $ jaro compose friend@home.net
But if you don't remember the email of your friend, then you can just
start *jaro compose* without options, then start typing the
name or whatever you remember of it: pressing the *Tab* key a
completion will help to remind what you are looking for, offering a
list of options to choose from.

If you are writing an email with attachments (and you are sure their
size is reasonably small to be circulated via email) you can launch
Jaro Mail with files as arguments, or even wildcards, and they will be
automatically set as attachments, you can then specify its recipients
: $ jaro picture01.jpg jingle02.mp3 ~/myicons/*
Will send a mail with various separate attachments (using MIME
encapsulation): a picture, an hopefully small audio file and a list of
icons which are all the files contained into the myicons/ directory.

After composing the email you will be able to review all those
attachments and eventually remove some of them by hand: move up and
down across them and then click [ *D* ] to remove the selected one.

** Reply messages

While browsing through the index of emails in various folders, one can
reply any of them just by pressing the [ *r* ] key, which will ask if
the original message should be quoted and then open your favorite
editor to compose your text.

If the email you are replying has been sent to multiple recipients
(for instance using multiple addresses in the Cc: or From: fields)
they will all be included, but you will have the possibility to
exclude them by hand editing those fields.

It is also possible to forward a message to someone else than the
sender, for instance to submit it to his or her attention, or that of
a mailinglist. To do that, you can use the [ *f* ] key which will
present you with the full message and the possibility to write
something on top of it, to describe its contents to its new
recipients.

** Peek without downloading anything

If you are around and like to see your new mails without downloading
them, then you can use the *peek* function:
: $ jaro peek
This will open the default configured IMAP account and folder over SSL
protocol (securing the data transfer) and show your emails.

From peek you can reply and even delete emails, but be careful since
what you delete here will be removed from the server and won't be
there when you download it from home.

This functionality can be also very useful if you are from a slow
connection and need to delete some email that is clogging it and that
you are not able to download because of its size.


** Send emails whenever possible

All the time you write an E-mail, Jaro Mail will save it into your
outbox folder, waiting for the right moment to send it. In fact you
will have to tell it the right moment by running the *send* command:
: $ jaro send
This will authenticate with your SMTP and send all your emails to
destination. This way even if you are off-line you will always be able
to write emails and eventually bring them around for sending them
whenever possible.

** Save important emails for later

Sometimes one can be on the rush while reading emails (local or via
imap) and flagging them as important can be useful to keep focus on
priorities. In some cases it is very useful to save such important
messages locally for later reference, for instance in a folder keeping
messages that need to be remembered and that will constitute a kind of
TODO list (a'la GTD).

Jaro Mail implements such functionalities: by pressing the [ *F* ] key
(shift-f) one can flag an email, which will turn bright-green in the
index. In addition to that there is a folder called *remember/* where
one can copy emails on the fly using the [ *R* ] key (shift-r) any
time. Messages will be duplicated into the remember folder (which of
course can be opened with the command *jaro remember*) so they can
also be edited with annotations on the task they refer to, for
instance using the [ *e* ] key, without affecting the original
message.

** Workflow in brief

Below a recapitulation of keys commonly used in our workflow

| Key   | Function                             |
|-------+--------------------------------------|
| *m*   | Compose a new message                |
| *Tab* | Complete addresses and folders input |
| *r*   | Reply to the sender of a message     |
| *g*   | Group reply to all recipients        |
| *f*   | Forward a message to new recipients  |
| *=*   | List all filtered maildir folders    |
| *c*   | Change to another folder             |
| *F*   | Flag a message as important          |
| *R*   | Copy a message to remember           |
| *s*   | Move a message to another folder     |
| *C*   | Copy a message to another folder     |

* Searching

  Searching across all your emails it is as important as demanding of
  a task. Jaro Mail implements it using Mairix, a portable program
  written by a bunch of talented programmers in portable C language.

  After the indexing is done, you can use the command *jaro search*
  followed by any number of arguments to run the search.

  If one of the arguments given to the search command is the name of
  an existing email directory folder in ~/Mail, then the search will
  be on contents of the folder. 

  More than one word is aloud to refine the match (they are all AND'ed
  together), plus a number of tricks can be done: every single word
  following the command can be a particular expression that indicates
  in which header to search and for what.

  Here below a short reference of possible expressions:[fn:mairixdate]

[fn:mairixdate] For a reference on how the date range works in search expressions, you can look into the *Backup* section in this manual.


  | word          | match word in message body and major headers                           |
  | t:word        | match word in To: header                                               |
  | c:word        | match word in Cc: header                                               |
  | f:word        | match word in From: header                                             |
  | a:word        | match word in To:, Cc: or From: headers (address)                      |
  | s:word        | match word in Subject: header                                          |
  | b:word        | match word in message body                                             |
  | m:word        | match word in Message-ID: header                                       |
  | n:word        | match name of attachment within message                                |
  | F:flags       | match on message flags (s=seen,r=replied,f=flagged,-=negate)           |
  | p:substring   | match substring of path                                                |
  | d:start-end   | match date range                                                       |
  | z:low-high    | match messages in size range                                           |
  | bs:word       | match word in Subject: header or body (or any other group of prefixes) |
  | s:word1,word2 | match both words in Subject:                                           |
  | s:word1/word2 | match either word or both words in Subject:                            |
  | s:~word       | match messages not containing word in Subject:                         |
  | s:substring=  | match substring in any word in Subject:                                |
  | s:^substring= | match left-anchored substring in any word in Subject:                  |
  | s:substring=2 | match substring with <=2 errors in any word in Subject:                |

  If none of the arguments is an email folder existing in ~/Mail then
  the search will be run over addressbook whitelist entries, returning
  addresses of found contacts.


* Security

** Password storage

Our MUA (Mutt) and our MTA (Fetchmail) normally required the user to
input the email account password every time or write it clear inside a
plain text file, jeopardizing the secrecy of it.

But most desktops nowadays have a keyring that stores passwords that
are often used during a session, saving the user from retyping them
every time.

Jaro Mail provides an interesting (and long awaited) feature even for
those who are already using Mutt for their email: *it stores passwords
securely*. This is done in different ways depending from the operating
system is being running on.

Jaro Mail will use the default keyring whenever present to store all
new passwords for each account used: the first time will prompt for a
password and, while using it, will save it in relation to the
particular account. This way the user can simply authenticate into the
keyring at login and, while managing such sensitive informations using
OS specific tools, Jaro Mail can be launched without the tedious task
of a password input every time e-mails are being checked.

On *Apple/OSX* the default internal keyring is being used.

On *GNU/Linux* only the gnome-keyring is supported for now.

To explicitly change a password one can operate the default keyring
manager or use the command *jaro passwd -a imap.default* (or other
accounts) which will prompt to set for a new password even if an old
one is known. If left blank, it will simply erase the password saved
for the account.

** Temporary directory

For its password management system to work, Jaro Mail often requires
to write down passwords in clear text, at least until software like
Fetchmail and Mutt is updated to avoid such a stupid need.

The way we overcome this limitation is by using a temporary directory,
making sure that all sensitive files created in it are deleted as soon
as possible, as well that no other user on the system has access to
them, but still we can't deny that an administrator access them.

If a ramdisk is present on the system it will be used by Jaro Mail:
that is a "volatile" directory in RAM whose contents are never written
on the disk. This prevents an intruder to seize the machine and
recover deleted data from unused sectors on the hard-disk, because all
data saved in RAM gets irremediably lost after approximately 2 minutes
the machine is switched off for such an operation.

On *Apple/OSX* systems to enable this feature one must explicitly
activate the ramdisk using the command
: $ jaro ramdisk open
This will create and mount /Volume/JaroTmp which is 10MB large and
will be used for our delicate security transactions.

On *GNU/Linux* systems this is done automatically if the shared memory
volume is available and writable (/dev/shm) without the need to use
the ramdisk command.

For the aforementioned reasons of writing passwords in clear text,
Jaro Mail also requires the use of safe deletion techniques as those
provided by *srm* (on Apple/OSX) and *wipe* (on GNU/Linux) every time
a file is deleted. So even if a ramdisk is not activated it will be
very hard if not impossible for an attacker to retreive information
from hard-disk sectors or using a cold-boot attack on RAM.

** A tip for GNU/Linux users

Those using a GNU/Linux system might want to have a look at our other
software *Tomb, the Crypto Undertaker*[fn:tomb] which takes care of quick mount
and umount of an encrypted volume when desired and includes a *hook*
mechanism to automatize the execution of commands to make a directory
inside the encrypted volume immediately available in the user's home.

[fn:tomb] http://tomb.dyne.org

Using a light combination of scripts between Jaro Mail and Tomb is
possible to achieve a strong level of personal security, definitely
above the average.

For more information about Tomb please refer to its own documentation.


* Storage and backup


Most existing e-mail systems have their own storage format which is
often over-complicated and forces us to convert our archives to it.

Jaro Mail stores emails using the well documented format *Maildir*
which is common to many other free and open source e-mail software and
was developed and well documented by D.J. Bernstein. 


We can safely say that the Maildir format to store e-mails will stay
the same and well compatible in 10 years from now, if not more, mostly
because of its simplicity: that's what we need the most from a storage
format after all.


Quoting him about the wonders of this format:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

Why should I use maildir?

Two words: no locks. An MUA can read and delete messages while new
mail is being delivered: each message is stored in a separate file
with a unique name, so it isn't affected by operations on other
messages. An MUA doesn't have to worry about partially delivered mail:
each message is safely written to disk in the tmp subdirectory before
it is moved to new. The maildir format is reliable even over NFS.[fn:djb]

#+END_QUOTE

[fn:djb] http://cr.yp.to/proto/maildir.html

What this virtuous, sometimes very cryptical man is trying to say here
is that the Maildir format in its simplicity of implementation
represents an extremely reliable way to retreive and store emails
without the risk of losing any if the Internet connection goes down.

While skipping over the internal details of this storage system, which
basically consists in plain text files saved into sub-directories, we
will have a look at some very interesting features that Jaro Mail can
offer to its users and to the even larger audience of Maildir format

** Merge maildir

Jaro Mail can safely merge two different maildirs basically gathering
all e-mails stored in them into a unique place. This is done using two
arguments, both maildir folders: the first is the source and the
second is the destination e-mails from both will be gathered:
: $ jaro merge ml.saved-mails ml.global-archive
The above command will move all emails stored inside the maildir
folder "ml.saved-mails" to the other maildir folder
"ml.global-archive". Upon success the first argument "ml.saved-mails"
will be deleted and all its contents will be found in
"ml.global-archive".


** Remove duplicates from maildir

As a result of a merge or a multiple fetch of e-mails, it can often
occur that a maildir contains duplicates which are also highlighted in
red in the e-mail index and, if many, can be tedious to eliminate by
hand. Jaro Mail offers the automatic functionality of removing all
duplicate emails from a maildir folder using the *rmdupes* command:
: $ jaro rmdupes ml.overflow
Will look for all duplicates emails in the "ml.overlow" maildir,
matching them by their unique *Message-Id:* header and a SHA1 hash of
their content[fn:formail], and delete all duplicates for mails that
are present more than once.

[fn:formail] The standard utility 'formail -D' is used for this operation

** Backup mails older than

To facilitate the separate storage of e-mails that are too old to be
of any interest, but still might be useful to be retrieved just in
case, Jaro Mail implements a function that will move all messages
older than a certain date out of a maildir folder into another.
: $ jaro backup ml.recent ml.yearsago d:5y-1y
The above command will move out of the "ml.recent" maildir all e-mails
that are older than 1 year (up to 5 years before, can be more) and
stores them into the "ml.yearsago" maildir which for instance could be
present on an external usb hard-disk or any other backup device,
helping us to save space on the desktop in use.
:  jaro backup unsorted d:may98-may99 unsorted.week.old
Will move all emails found in any folder that are dated between May
1998 and May 1999. Here below more examples of date range expressions:
d:2002-2003 d:may2002-2003 d:2002may-2003 d:feb98-15may99 d:feb98-15may1999 d:2feb98-1y d:02feb98-1y d:970617-20010618


** Filter a maildir

If filters are updated or one desires to import a maildir into Jaro
Mail processing it through its filters, the *filter* command is
provided to (re)filter a maildir.
: $ jaro filter my-old-maildir
Beware that filtering is a lengthy operation, especially on big
maildirs: it will first pass all messages found through your filters,
refiling them to folders (even creating duplicates) and then prune all
the affected folders to remove the duplicates.


* Usability tips

** Quickly send a file via email on Apple/OSX

   To right-click on a file and send it via email attach using Jaro
   Mail you must create a "Service" using the application
   "Automator". It is fairly simple:

   1) Start Automator
   2) Choose the Service template
   3) In the dropdown boxes that appear choose “files or folders” and “Finder”
   4) Look for "Run Applescript" in the Library tree
   5) Drag "Run Applectript" in  the workflow area and paste this script into it:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
on run {input, parameters}
	tell application "Terminal"
		activate
		tell window 1
			do script "~/Mail/jaro/bin/jaro " & POSIX path of input
		end tell
	end tell
end run
#+END_EXAMPLE
   
   Now Save the new service (you can name it "Send file via Jaro
   Mail") and when you will right click on a file, in the submenu
   "Services" you will find the option you just scripted, which will
   open a Terminal asking you the email address, while the file will
   be already configured as attach.




* Acknowledgements

Jaro Mail would have never been possible without the incredible amount
of Love shared by the free and open source community, since it is
relying on the development of software like Procmail, Mutt, Fetchmail
and even more code which is included and used by this program.

Heartfelt thanks go to all those contributing code and sharing it to
make the world a better place by not letting down all users in the
hands of corporate non-sense and proprietary technologies and
protocols.

This manual is written and maintained by Jaromil who is also the one
who wrote the Jaro Mail scripts. Still he is far from being the person
that wrote most of the code running here, just the one who organized
it in an hopefully intuitive way for users.

In the following chapters the best is done in order to credit most
people that contributed to free and open source software that Jaro
Mail makes use of.

** Jaro Mail credits

Jaro Mail is written and maintained by Denis Roio (aka Jaromil) it
started from the intention to share his own 10 years old e-mail setup,
encouraged by the geek tradition of exchanging configuration files
between friends.

The RFC 822 address parser (fetchaddr) is originally written by
Michael Elkins for the Mutt MUA.

The gateway to Apple/OSX addressbook (ABQuery) was written by Brendan
Cully and just slightly updated for our distribution.

Special thanks go to Alvise Gottieri, Anatole Shaw, Francesco Politi
and Fabio Pietrosanti for early testing and debugging.

** Mutt credits

Please note that this is by no means an exhaustive list of all the
persons who have been contributing to Mutt.  Please see the
manual for a (probably still non complete) list of the persons who
have been helpful with the development of Mutt. Our special thanks go to
Antonio Radici, the Mutt maintainer in Debian, for his suggestions and
encouragement.

** Procmail credits

Procmail was originally designed and developed by Stephen R. van den Berg.

In the fall of 1998, recognizing that he didn't have the time to
maintain procmail on his own, Stephen created a mailing list for
discussion of future development and deputized Philip Guenther as a
maintainer.

The included Procmail library collection is developed and maintained
by Jari Aalto.
